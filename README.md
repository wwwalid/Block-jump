# Block-jump
First AI Project implementing NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. I created an AI block that has to avoid obstacles simply by jumping.
The algorithm used is a genetic algorithm, which means that in each generation the "fittest" genomes are selected and used to create the next generation.
In this case, the best genome is the block which survived the longest.
